homepage
	use this as inspiration to make me a homepage for a website that hosts apps for startups. make it look futuristic and elegant. make it use dark mode and have a bluish green color pallete. make it have a hero section where it explains our business in the least amount of words possible while still being captivating (its a place for hosting apps for startups and also has tools for developers to make their work easier). make it have a section for the different services offered (make up 3 core services and a button labelled view all) and make it have a testimonials section (make up random reviews from at least 3 former clients and ongoing clients) and add a brands section (just a line with 5 company logos on it) make an advantages section where you display the core advantages of choosing us over another person then add an FAQs section (just accordions with a question and an answer when expanded) and a pricing section (3 tiers - individual, corporate and enterprise) (make up as many items as you need to, just make it make sense for the core offering) then lastly a contact us section with a form a user can submit to us then a footer (nothing fancy just 3 panels - business info,site menu (the basic stuff), features)
