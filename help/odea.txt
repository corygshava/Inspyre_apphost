the idea is to create a singular place for viewing all my side projects and tools all in one place. 
features
    all the tools will be in a simple easy to access area 
    they will be divided into tools, apps and miniapps (too big to be a tool, too specific to be an app)
    there will also be a place for toolkits (basically code to make work easier)
    any user can bookmark the tools they like for easy access later
    it will use a js file to hold the data then later will rely on API calls to a json file for the same
